A short kata about how to represent money in Java.

## Introduction
We have been hired to make a ‘pay the bill at a restaurant app’

We need to represent Money internally
There are three basic operations we need to be able to perform:
* Add two monies together
* Subtract money
* Divide the money by N where N is an integer

We have helper methods
* Add up a list of monies
* Split money evenly between n people

Your task is to write the helper methods

## Step 1

What is the basic data model. Do we use
* Integer
* Double
* BigDecimal
* A ‘tinytype’ representing money
* Something else?

Make a decision and write the helper class
* Add up a list of monies
* Split money evenly between n people
